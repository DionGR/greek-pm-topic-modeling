\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
In such a rapidly expanding field like text analytics and natural language processing and with the power of deep neural models, tackling multilingual tasks is more accessible than ever. The integration of such technologies is rapidly transforming the landscape, opening up a great amount of possibilities for both advancing multilingual research as well as creating useful models with specific applications in these languages. In our case, we leverage an array of topic models using the Optimizing and Comparing Topic Models Is Simple (OCTIS) \citep{Terragni;Fersini;Galuzzi;Tropeano;Candelieri;21} library and BERTopic \citep{grootendorst2022bertopic} so as to perform an analysis on a corpus of modern Greek political speeches and statements issued by the Prime Minister's office from 2012 to 2024. Our frozen-in-time model approach will make full use of the unlabeled data and allowing these models to achieve optimal performance in extracting topics for offline, unsupervised tasks aimed primarily at dataset evaluation.

This project not only presents an analytical study but also sets the foundational framework by outlining the dataset selection process, addressing the unique challenges of pre-processing texts in the Greek language, and understanding the rationale behind our methodological choices. With our approach, we aim to contribute to both the academic and practical stakeholders in the field of modern Greek text analysis.
