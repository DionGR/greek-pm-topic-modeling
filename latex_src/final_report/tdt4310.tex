\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In this project, we explore a variety of topic modeling techniques with a focus on their application to a corpus of modern Greek political texts. We analyze and compare several classic generative models with state-of-the-art neural models, which provides an extensively modular framework for deep learning based topic modeling. By leveraging these sophisticated models, we aim to address the challenges of unsupervised topic modeling, such as their interpretability and incompatibility with quantitative metrics. Our approach involves a sophisticated experimental setup where models are fine-tuned and compared using a variety of topic coherence, diversity and similarity metrics. This study not only tests the effectiveness of different topic modeling techniques but also examines their application in a linguistically diverse dataset and the challenges that come with it - such as text pre-processing - providing insights that could benefit further research in the area of topic modeling for Greek corpora.
