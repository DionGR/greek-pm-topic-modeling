\section{Alternative Project Ideas}
\label{sec:alt_pj}

While we are confident that this topic is interesting, we offer the examiner alternative ideas we considered during the preparation of this phase - should they deem that the main topic should be changed. Main alternatives were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Neural machine translation for European languages} using the EU Parallel Translation Corpus\cite{eucorpus}.
    \item \textbf{Greek court tranascript summarization} using the GreekLegalSum\cite{grcourt} dataset.
\end{itemize}
