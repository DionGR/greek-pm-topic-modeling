\section{Project Theme}
\label{sec:Introduction}

This project aims to analyze the thematic content of speeches and statements delivered by Greek Prime Ministers over the past twelve years (2012-2024). This has been an eventful period for Greece as it coincides with a significant economic crisis, refugee scandals, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic - all while alternating between  left and right wing governments in a late-and-post-crisis Greece. We will make use of topic modeling techniques so as to hopefully identify recurring and relevant topics as well as analyze this data scientifically in order to draw conclusions regarding the state of affairs in modern day Greek politics.
